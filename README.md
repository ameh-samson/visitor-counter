# visitor-counter

This is a visitor counter app. It helps in counting the number of visitors that enter the house manually.
It has an increment button and a save button. Whenever the increment button is pressed, it increases the count 
by one, and as soon as the save button is pressed, the current count is stored in the paragraph, and this resets the counter back to zero.

This project is a mixture of basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
